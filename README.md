# way_app

Find your friend's location on the map

## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

## Run `flutter pub get`
## Run `dart migrate --apply-changes` for null-safety 
## Run `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` after you edit the locations.dart file

## NB: This project uses null-safety
